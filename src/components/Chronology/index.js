        <div className = "row">
            <h1 className = "text">	&emsp;This chronology contains a collection of 50 dates (not including the Balkan Wars) for Timothy Snyder’s History of Eastern Europe class since 1914. It begins in 1914 with the start of WWI and ends 
                in the early 21st century with the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in 2005.
                It reflects upon the clash of several themes during this time period, 
                including the decline of empires, fluidity of regimes, fluidity of boundaries, fluidity of people, and a variety of political regimes. 
                More specifically, however, this chronology will focus on how these themes surfaced in Eastern Europe with respect to 
                the national question and state formation, the failure of democracy and national self-determination during the interwar period, Soviet political control, 
                Nazi Germany’s exploitation of the national question, the rise and fall of communism in Eastern Europe following WWII, and a post-communist order. 
                This chronology will hopefully narrate how the political, social, and economic trajectories of nations in Eastern Europe have contributed
                largely to the state of their nation today. </h1>

                            <h3>Balkan Wars</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;Despite the Balkan Wars not falling within the timeline, they are important in contextualizing the buildup to the first World War. 
                                In 1912, Eastern Europe was principally a land of empires. 
                                The Ottoman Empire had existed for half a millennium alongside the German Empire, Austrian-Hungarian Empire, and Russian Empire. 
                                However, during the 18th and 19th century, the Ottoman Empire began to decline with the rise of the Eastern Question<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump1"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>,which entailed severe political and economic instability that would eventually lead to the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. 
                                This provided room for several nation states such as Montenegro, Romania, and Bulgaria to form in the periphery. In 1912, these newly formed nations not only attacked 
                                the Ottoman Empire, but drove them out of their territories. 
                                This was a huge turning point in Eastern European history because it was the first demonstration 
                                that empires at the time were not indestructible but instead malleable. Furthermore, the rise of the Balkan states raised the national question throughout Eastern Europe.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The rise of Serbian nationalism increased tensions between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the early 20th<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump2"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>. Many Serbian nationalists argued Bosnia Herzegovina belonged to Serbia on the basis that the majority of Bosnia
                                Herzegovina was inhabited by Serbs. This demonstrated and foreshadowed one of the key and complicated aspects of the national question that 
                                many newly formed Eastern European nations would face – who belongs to a nation and what boundaries define a nation. At the height of the tensions between Serbia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb nationalist part of the Black Hand, assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Hapsburg Monarchy in Sarajevo. In response to the murder of their Archduke, on 28 July 1914, the Hapsburg Monarchy declared war on Serbia, and thus began World War I.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The first World War was an armed conflict between the Central Powers consisting of the German Empire, the Hapsburg monarchy, 
                                the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria, and the Entente Powers including France, the Russian Empire, Great Britain, Italy, Serbia, and the United States. 
                                The war “broke the old land empires of Europe, while inspiring dreams of new ones”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump3"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>.Ultimately the dissolution of the Austria-Hungary, German, and Ottoman empires sharpened the national question throughout Eastern Europe<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump4"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.For instance, Romania entered on the war on the side of the allies on the promise of Transylvania, Poland saw the war as an opportunity to gain lands in Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Russia, and Czechoslovakia, the engine of the old Hapsburg Monarchy was tasked with picking a side of the battle to preserve its people from becoming minorities after the war. In concert with the national question, 
                                the dissolution of empires brought with it a replacement of the “dynastic principle of rule by emperor with a fragile idea of popular sovereignty”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump5"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>.Despite ending a period of autocratic and ruling by emperors, World War I brought a new challenge to Eastern European nations – answering the national question.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Treaty of London was a secret agreement between Italy and the Entente powers during the first World War, which promised Italy territorial gains alongside Austria-Hungary’s Adriatic coast under the condition that they fought alongside the Entente. The Entente powers had fought in support of national self-determination, making this agreement inherently contradictory as those territories had belonged to Serbians and Croatians. Realizing this after the war when discussing the formation of Yugoslavia, the British and French went back on the terms of the agreement. 
                                In 1918, however, Italy had limited Yugoslavia’s right to national self-determination when they forcibly took territories that they had been promised<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump6"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.Italy’s denial of the territory promised in the Treaty of London led to a period of nationalistic and revisionist attitude after the war and the rise of Italian fascism in the period leading up to and during the second World War.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Russian Revolution of 1917 was carried out by the Bolsheviks, Marxists in the Russian Empire, who were led by Vladmir Lenin and Leon Trotsky. 
                                From the perspective of Lenin, a revolution carried out by the Bolsheviks would be the “spark that would ignite the powder keg” and carry history forward.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump7"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>The Bolsheviks overthrew the Russian provisional government and promised reform. During the revolution, 
                                Lenin advocated for national self-determination and support of peasants to appeal other nations to their revolutionary cause. 
                                However, this was a mere tactic to mask his true intentions of ending capitalism, and in was a direct exploitation of the nationalistic 
                                fervor throughout Eastern Europe. In addition, with the immense expansion of the Russian Empire “the Russian Empire, Great Russian in its origin, ceased being such in its ethnic composition."<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump8"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>The Russian Empire no longer had a means of addressing the national question and thus fell on December 30 1922 with the formation of the Soviet Union.

                            <p>
                            &emsp;The Corfu Declaration established political unification between the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes 
                            and granted them the right to form an independent state known as the Kingdom of Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump9"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup>The Corfu declaration was backed by Great Britain and France and its signing symbolized the acknowledgement of Croat, Serbian, and Slovene’s right to national self-determination. However, the formation of Yugoslavia was reluctant from the Croat and Serbian perspective. Croats and Serbs were forced to cooperate with each other in response to the imminent threat of Italian troops arriving after WWI on the premises of the Treaty of London.  
                            Furthermore, the three entities had fundamentally different historical narratives -- 
                            Serbia’s history being oriented around expansionism and nationalism and Croatia’s history being oriented around reciprocity and historical rights.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump10"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>These differences were made evident in the December 1st merger of the three entities, where there was a lack of safeguarding for Serbian dominance and the negligence of the national question for Croats and Slovenes.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump11"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>The Corfu Declaration seemingly championed the notion of national self-determination; however, the national question had not been solved at all, but was rather displaced and substituted with a temporary solution. This temporary solution 
                            would not suffice in the long-run, as national tensions between Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes began to grow, eventually leading to the dissolution of Yugoslavia in 1991.

                            <h3>Treaty of Versailles</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Treaty of Versailles officially ended World War I, and highlights one of the inherent issues of national self-determination in Eastern Europe after the war. 
                                That is, national self-determination was permitted in Eastern Europe insofar as the allied victors of the first World War allowed it to. 
                                The treaty prohibited Anschluss – the political inclusion of Austria in the German state.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump12"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup>Additionally, the post-war settlement placed much of the blame of the war on Germany, forcing Germany to forfeit a significant amount of its pre-war territory, disarm its military unit, and pay for the reparation of damage it had caused.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump13"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup>Though these terms did not directly prohibit Germany’s right to national self-determination, 
                                they hindered the survival of their nation. The terms of Versailles crippled the German economy. Further, 
                                German soldiers had won the war on the Eastern front and were furious on the forced measures their nation had to take after the war. 
                                The Treaty of Versailles led to a revisionist and nationalistic Germany, which opened a power vacuum for Hitler to come to power on January 30, 1930.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;Similar to the Treaty of Versailles, the Treaty of Saint German was another one of the post-war settlements demonstrating the impartial choice of the victorious powers of World War I in recognizing a nation’s right to self-determination. The Treaty of Saint German forced Austria to face significant territorial losses, amounting to over sixty percent of their prewar territory. 
                                Further, Austria had been crushed economically and socially by the war and thus many Austrians determined Austria “Lebensunfähigkeit” – incapable of life.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump14"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>As a result, Austrians declared itself the republic of “German Austria” indicating their desire for an Austria-German unification.
                                However, France was naturally opposed to an Austrian-German unification, Anschluss, given the destruction that Germany had imposed on France during the war. 
                                The ban on Anschluss, was inherently contradictory, as the Entente powers had joined the war on the promotion of national self-determination yet denied Austria from joining Germany.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Treaty of Trianon underscores the correlation between the right to national self-determination and the success of democracy in Eastern Europe. 
                                The Treaty acknowledges the right to national self-determination and existence of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Austria, and Romania but fell short in acknowledging Hungary as an independent nation. 
                                The Treaty forced Hungary to forfeit most of their pre-war territory and cede Transylvania to Romania.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump15"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>The allies’ pre-war commitment of giving Transylvania to Romania was inherently contradictory to the notion of national self-determination as it disregarded Hungary’s borders. The loss of this territory led to the displacement of millions of Hungarians in neighboring countries. With Hungary being forced to sign the treaty and their right to national self-determination forsaken, Hungary quickly became a revisionist state where democracy did not get implemented after the war. 
                                Furthermore, Hungary’s revisionist attitude eventually leads to join WWII on the side of Nazi Germany, 
                                after Hitler’s promise to resolve Hungary’s national question of borders.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump16"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> <sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump17"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>

                            <h3>Treaty of Riga</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Treaty of Riga, also known as the Peace of Riga, concluded the Polish-Soviet war and demonstrated the failure of national self-determination in Ukraine. After the formation of an independent Poland, Polish nationalism led to desire to expand westward into Ukraine.  Simultaneously, with the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Lenin’s plan had only started to unfold – the next objective would be to spread revolution throughout Europe. Polish and Soviet forces came head-on, and eventually concluded with a Polish victory in Riga and the formation of the Treaty of Riga. The treaty established a border between Poland and the Soviet Union, but ignored the borders of Ukraine, which had been the primary battle ground location of the war. Ukraine did not gain sovereignty after 1918 or thereafter and would instead fall under the Soviet Republic. 
                                Thus, the national question in Ukraine was no longer in the hands of Ukrainians but rather the Soviet Union.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump18"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup>The Treaty of Riga highlighted the limitations of the implementation of national self-determination in Eastern Europe – the further west a nation was the less control the British and French have. Under Soviet influence and their interpretation of the national question in Ukraine, millions of Ukrainians suffered oppressive policies that limited the nation’s survival. For instance, during Stalin’s Five-Year Plan in 1928 millions of Ukrainians starved. Another consequence of the Treaty of Riga was that it defeated Lenin’s plan to spread communism throughout Europe and spread a global revolution. 
                                This led to the drawing of Soviet Union’s borders and the official formation of the Soviet Union on 30 December, 1922.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump19"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup>

                            <h3>Death of Vladimir Lenin</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;The death of Vladimir Lenin spurred a huge scramble for power in the Soviet Union. 
                                Lenin’s death left behind the question of how the Soviet Union can imitate capitalist industrialization without capitalism and simultaneously transform a backwards country 
                                of peasants into a country of workers by imitating capitalist industrialism. Stalin seized power by casting himself as the Politburo center.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump20"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup>He first sided with those that favored a slow progression of collectivized agriculture and then proceeded to switch sides and favor rapid collectivization. This strategy foreshadowed Stalin’s political strategy up until his death on 5 March 1953 – Stalin defined the political truth and dictated that everything else was false. Soviet nationalism was thus defined under what Stalin defined it to be and those who deviated from this were purged or punished. 
                                For instance, in denial of the failure of his Five-Year Plan, Stalin instead claimed that low agricultural yield was “caused by Ukrainian traitors seeking to sabotage collectivization."<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump21"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>Additionally, under the Stalinist line, the Holocaust was not allowed to exist in the Soviet Union as it undermined the Soviet resistance to the war and portrayed Soviet collaboration during the war. 
                                Thus, Stalin purged and executed Jewish nationalists who aimed to educate those about the Holocaust within the Soviet Union.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump21"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup>The influence of this strategy extended beyond the Soviet Union, as we will see in Yugoslavia deviation from Stalin’s communist line leading to the Tito-Stalin split.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;Hitler’s Mein Kampf narrates much of the resentment of revisionist Germany during the interwar period. 
                                In Mein Kampf, Hitler spells out his plan for Eastern Europe, seeing it as Lebensraum – living –space that would fulfill a historic destiny. 
                                Hitler describes his repugnance for other races and appeals to German nationalism by claiming that the German race was superior. 
                                Thus, Hitler’s plan of acquiring Lebensraum in Eastern Europe was to drive out its inhabitants and create space for the Germans. 
                                For instance, Hitler details his vision for Ukraine, seeing it as a breadbasket that belonged to Germans by law of nature.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump23"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup>In addition, Hitler with the rise of Austrian nationalism and Austria inching away from German dependence, Hitler attempted to provoke an Austria-German unity by mentioning the historic and ethnic right to be one nation.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump24"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>
                                Mein Kampf also portrayed Hitler’s antisemitic perspective that Jews were the root of all evil.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump25"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup>Though Hitler’s rise to power and gaining of support on was fundamentally because of his nationalist and socialist views, Hitler quickly unraveled his real political intentions towards Jews as demonstrated in the period leading up to and during WWII. As we will see, Hitler’s plans for Lebensraum in Mein Kampf reflect a danger in national self-determination; it can easily be weaponized to undermine the national self-determination of other nations and deny fundamental rights of other people.

                                &emsp;Stjepan Radić assassination in parliament was a prominent example of how interwar democracy failed in Eastern Europe due to an inability to answer the national question. 
                                Radić was a Croatian politician who played a major role in the Croatian nation awakening and fought for peasant and Croatia voice within Yugoslavia.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump26"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup>
                                His policies and his backing by Croatia were symbolic of Croatian desire for national self-determination. 
                                The Corfu Declaration had solved the national 
                                question regarding Yugoslavia but led to a nation where the national self-determination of Croats was stifled by that of the majority Serbian population.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump27"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup>The assassination of Radić thus symbolized the fall of democracy in Yugoslavia during the interwar period, made clear by King Alexander’s declaration of royal dictatorship on 6 January 1929.

                                &emsp;Stalin’s Five-Year plan reflect how Ukraine’s denial of national self-determination via the Treaty of Riga led to the death of over five million Ukrainian citizens. 
                                Stalin’s Five-Year Plan was instituted to rapidly control agricultural output and feed the working className of the Soviet Union. 
                                This would lead to Soviet industrialization and the growth of the Soviet Union’s economy.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump28"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup>With Ukraine not gaining sovereignty after World War 1 and instead belonging to the Soviet Republic, Ukraine did not have the ability to interpret its only national question. Rather, Ukraine fell under the interpretation of Soviet leader Josef Stalin. 
                                Thus, Stalin saw Ukraine as a breadbasket and a puppet of the Soviet Union and most of the Soviet collectivization during Stalin’s Five-Year plan occurred in Ukraine.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump29"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup>When agricultural yield drops significantly, Stalin closes Ukrainian borders and purges Ukrainian writers who don’t follow the Stalinist line.

                                &emsp;Black Tuesday marked the beginning of a contagion that would depress economies worldwide, known as the Great Depression. The effect of the Great Depression was particularly severe on the nations of Eastern Europe due their lack of capital, agrarian nature, lack of foreign investment, and lack of institutional protection of free trade.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump30"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup>The Great Depression was a major turning point in Eastern Europe as it discredited liberal democracy, free markets, and the nation state model.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump31"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref30">31</a></sup>For instance, Polish citizens stopped trusting the state as state policies seemed to be detrimentally conservative (Lecture 4). As a result, the people of Eastern Europe began to turn to Nazism and Marxism as radical alternatives. 
                                In fact, the Great Depression was a major factor in Hitler’s rise to power. 
                                Nazism grew popular in Eastern Europe at the time not because of its fascist ideology but because of the economic collapse of the Great Depression.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump32"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup>Further, this led to many nations turning to Soviet communist model following WWII as both the Nazi and Western model had been discredited.

                                &emsp;The Reichstag Fire marked the end of representative democracy in Germany during the interwar period. 
                                Less than a month after Hitler comes to power in Germany, the Reichstag, the German parliament building in Berlin is set on fire and burned down. 
                                Though it was unclear who had burned the building, Hitler saw it as an opportunity to instate a new German regime. 
                                In the Reichstag Fire Decree, Hitler blamed the crisis on communists undermining the German nation and suspended civil liberties such as freedom of speech, 
                                freedom of press and the right to assembly in Germany. Further, the Reichstag Fire Decree established Germany as a one-party state governed by the Nazi party. 
                                Under his new proposed regime, Hitler was able to remove all political enemies and overrule local and state laws.

                                &emsp;Germany’s absorption of Austria in March 1938 demonstrates Nazi Germany’s exploitation of the national question as a decoy for its ulterior motive of conquering Eastern Europe. With the Treaty of Versailles and Treaty of St. Germain placing a ban on an Austria-Germany unification, Austrian nationalism eventually began to grow in the 1920s. However, with Hitler describing Anschluss as inevitable in Mein Kampf in 1925, he ignored the existence of Austria as an independent nation. When Austrian Prime Minister Ignaz Seipel refused a merger with Germany, Hitler carried out an invasion of Austrian on 11 March 1938. 
                                Hitler argued on the grounds that Austria and Germany belonged in one nation because of ethnic unity, however “such goals of national unity, dramatic as they were,

                                &emsp;The Munich Accords led to Nazi Germany’s annexation of Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia and were an indication of Western powers falling victim of Nazi Germany’s exploitation of the national question. 
                                The Allies fell trap into Hitler’s argument for national self-determination that “the three million Germans of Czechoslovakia, 
                                and the regions they inhabited” must be allowed to join Germany.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump37"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup>In appeasing Germany and granting them the right to national self-determination, 
                                the allied powers failed to respect the principle of national self-determination 
                                for Czechoslovakia who had never agreed to the Allies’ terms. 
                                Again, we see the interplay between the failure of upholding national self-determination and the discrediting of democracy, 
                                as Czechoslovakia turned towards the Eastern bloc after the second World War. 
                                Additionally, like the case of Austria and Anschluss, Hitler had masked his desire to conquer the entirety of Eastern Europe with the national question. 
                                Moreover, “Hitler was an opportunist in that he understood well his adversaries’ weaknesses and how to exploit them.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump38"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup>He understood that after acquiring the Sudetenland Czechoslovakia was open to full scale invasion and there would be no allied interference. 
                                Since Czechoslovakia, like Austria, was an economic engine and industrialized society with many exploitable resources, 
                                Hitler thereby proceeded to invade Czechoslovakia in March 1939 leading to the dissolution of the Czechoslovakia state.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939 was a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. However, it signaled the beginning of a period of double occupation in Eastern Europe by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The pact carved out how various territories in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, and Finland would be partitioned between the two powers. Prior to the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany opposed each other, attempting to fill the power vacuum with their drastically different ideologies. This changed following the Pact. In his novel Black Earth, The Holocaust as History and Warning, 
                                Timothy Snyder argues during the period of double occupation the Soviet Union and Germany “created material, psychological, and political resources” for each other to exploit the national question in Eastern Europe.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump39"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup>This is most clearly shown in the German invasion of Poland in 1939 and the massacre of Polish intelligentsia carried out by the Soviet secret police in Katyn in 1940.

                                &emsp;Hitler’s invasion of Poland illustrated how Nazi Germany’s weaponization of national self-determination radicalized the citizens of Poland. Unlike Austria and Czechoslovakia, the Wehrmacht found large resistance in Poland. 
                                Thus, to justify the killing of Poles and the elimination of the Polish state altogether, German soldiers were under the pretext that Poland did not exist as a nation.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump40"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup>This portrayed resisting and killings of the German, ‘master race’, as murder on behalf of Poles. With that logic, German troops saw it perfectly legitimate to commit atrocious war crimes against the Poles. Moreover, under Nazi Germany’s definition of national self-determination involved Lebensraum in which Germans could live. This meant that any Polish culture and resistance would be contractionary 
                                and led to decapitation of Polish society through Nazis killing “the most accomplished Poles."<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump41"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref40">41</a></sup>Another aspect of Nazi Germany’s national question was the Jewish question. 
                                This question emerged following the invasion of Poland as the annexation of Polish territory resulted in over two million Polish-Jews being brought into German territory. <sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump42"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref41">42</a></sup>

Like Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union justified the invasion of Poland on the pretext that they were rescuing Belarusians and Ukrainians from Polish decadence and political collapse. This idea of national self-determination and the right to protect the Soviet Union’s people, was used as a decoy to expand the Soviet Union westward. 
                                In adding this territory, the Soviet Union decapitated Polish elites to preserve className ideology.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump43"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup>Germany later discovers the Katyn Massacre later during the war and uses it as a political maneuver to cause tension between Poles and Soviets, in preparation for their betrayal of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump44"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup>

                                &emsp;On the surface, Operation Barbarossa indicated Germany’s betrayal of the Soviet Union and led to a period of war between the two powers. 
                                However, caught in the crossfire were those that had been doubly occupied beforehand. 
                                An example of this is how Operation Barbarossa drastically changed Nazi Germany’s approach to the Jewish question. 
                                With Nazi Germany on the retreat, many more Jews come under Nazi control and with Germany losing the war, they can no longer execute their plans of Jewish deportation. As such, this led to an increase in the number of innocent Jews killed during the Holocaust. 
                                Operation Barbarossa also led to ethnic cleansing and killings of innocent citizens by the Soviet Union. 
                                For instance, Latvians and Lithuanians had been deported en masse to the Soviet Gulag, a week before Operation Barbarossa. 
                                When the Germans invaded, the Soviets saw these prisoners as German threats and murdered them all. <sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump45"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup>Moreover, as the war finished the Soviet Union deported thousands of Caucasians and Crimeans, 
                                who were seen as Nazi collaborators during the war.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump46"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup>Operation Barbarossa demonstrates how the political current of Eastern Europe generated by two head-strong and opposing nations eliminated the possibility of national self-determination.

                                &emsp;Operation Reinhard was the Nazi policy of the complete elimination of Polish Jews.
                                <sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump47"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup>Operation Reinhard was a major turning point in World War II as it signified a shift in Nazi Germany’s solution to the Jewish question. 
                                Prior to Operation Reinhard, Nazi Germany’s solution to the Jewish question revolved around ethnic cleansing by deportation. 
                                However, with each territorial invasion carried out by the Nazi Empire, the Jewish question could no longer be answered solely by deportation. 
                                For instance, following the invasion of Poland, Nazi Germany had annexed over two million Poles, a large majority of which were Jewish. 
                                And so, Heinrich Himmler Heinrich Himmler, a leading member of the Nazi party, interpreted Hitler’s desires of solving the Jewish problem in Eastern Europe through the mass extermination of Jews. 
                                This marked the deadliest phase of the Holocaust, in which Nazi Germany claimed the lives of some 1.3 million Polish Jews.

                                &emsp;The Warsaw Uprising was a major event as it foreshadowed post-war Soviet communist influence in Eastern Europe. The Uprising was organized by the Polish home Army and Polish Jews and displayed a Polish agency in resisting German occupation. 
                                This resistance was primarily motivated by Soviet propaganda that had promised support in Warsaw. 
                                However, Stalin had planned all along for the Germans to perform his dirty work and destroy Warsaw while decapitating the Polish elite.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump49"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>The destruction of the Warsaw led to Soviet influence being appealing in post-war Poland because the communist project specialized in accelerated reconstruction. 
                                The Soviet denial of British and American aid to the Polish uprising made it clear that Stalin 
                                was not thinking about the end of World War II but rather the start of the Cold War –Stalin’s decision was all about postwar domination 
                                and the spread of communism rather than winning the World War II. 
                                When they arrived in eastern Poland in 1944 when Warsaw had already been destroyed, Soviets perpetrated the myth that their arrival was liberation from fascism.

                                Nazi army and were blindsided to the Soviet mission of spreading communism throughout Europe.

                                Despite the Soviet Union receiving half of Poland, they did not uphold their side of the agreement. 
                                Instead, the Poland government was carried out by Soviet communists.
                                Essentially after Yalta, Stalin had established Poland to become a puppet of the Soviet Union through the guise of supporting the Poles’
                                right to national self-determination by expelling Germans westward and cleansing Poland of its minorities.

                                It was formed in direct response to the growing influence of the West visible through the United States’ Marshall Plan, 
                                which provided foreign aid to many European countries post World War II. It also introduced the “two camp” idea,

The Cominform was a means for Stalin to dictate the postwar order of Eastern Europe. 
                                Stalinism meant that politics were personal, whoever dominated the party had total control over society.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump54"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup>However, Stalinism meant a rejection of any nuances or deviations in the Soviet communist system, which were natural based on the different social, political,

                                &emsp;The expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Cominform in 1948 demonstrated the Soviet Union’s intolerance to any form of communism falling outside the Stalinist line. Yugoslavia was different from other Soviet satellites – they had liberated themselves from Nazi occupation in Yugoslavia without the help of the Red Army. 
                                This gave Yugoslavia’s leader Josip Broz Tito to operate more independently and led to national communism in Yugoslavia.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump55"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref55">55</a></sup>Tito and Yugoslavia backed spreading communism throughout Eastern Europe and supported the communist revolution in Greece, 
                                however, Stalin saw this as a deviation from the Soviet line and denounced Yugoslavia as a fascist regime.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump56"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup>Despite Yugoslavia having had demonstrated its loyalty to the USSR as early as 1943, 
                                Stalin was upset that “no matter how much [Yugoslavia] love[d] the land of Socialism, the USSR, [Yugoslavs] can,

                                The Tito-Stalin split demonstrated that Stalin cared more about stabilizing his gains in Eastern Europe 
                                than spreading communist revolution – a precursor to the failure of communism through normalization and 
                                durability that would occur after Stalin’s death. Additionally, Yugoslavia turned towards the west which would demonstrate 
                                to other Eastern European nations that there was an exit to the Soviet system.

                                The Tito-Stalin Split carried through the fractured mirror of Stalinism a discussion about what other Stalinist deviations entailed. 
                                These discussions spurred an incentive for communists to denounce their comrades before their comrades could denounce them. 
                                Slánský last words also portray that Stalinism was not centered around raw power. 
                                Instead, it was a way of living politics where the ability to understand contradiction was essential.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;Stalin’s death in 1953 opened the possibility for a new communist order in post-war Eastern Europe.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump59"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup>The Soviet Union’s grip had loosened in Eastern Europe as shown by the Tito-Stalin Split, 
                                and Stalin’s economic plans for Eastern Europe had resulted in stagnation. 
                                Stalin’s death brought the question of what the trajectory of communism would now look like in Eastern Europe. 
                                Stalin had been the figurehead of the Soviet Union since he came to power in 1922 and had defined the political ‘truth’ 
                                or over 30 years. Stalin’s death thereby was the collapse of the very concrete understanding of what communism or socialism was. 
                                Many Eastern European nations to realize that Stalinist line had been completely fabricated. 
                                However, we will see beginning with Nikita Khrushchev that Stalin’s death did not mark the end of Stalinism but instead 
                                initiated a period of preserving the order of Stalinism.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump60"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup>The Soviet Union was no longer as absorbed with the internal affairs with its satellite states, 
                                but still, “the political future and lives of the individual Eastern European leaders 
                                still depended on their ability to adjust to the smallest changes in a now erratic and indeterminate Soviet official line.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump61"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref59">61</a></sup>

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Warsaw Pact was an indication that Soviet communism would not disappear following the immediate death of Stalin. In response to the eastern camp’s formation of NATO, the Pact established a defensive alliance between the Soviet Union and its satellite states. The Warsaw Pact had greater implicit consequences – specifically bringing back the issue of national self-determination. As satellite states began to see the weaknesses of consumerism brought by the Soviet system and the lack of social mobility beyond a generation, nationalism began to resurface in Eastern Europe. However, the Warsaw Pact kept nationalism within Soviet satellites in check with nationalism determined by the Soviet Union. In this sense, “nationalism was not a game the regimes could win. 
                                Their own anti-national pasts and their 
                                need to respect Soviet sensitivities stacked the cards against them.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump62"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>For example, when Hungary attempted to exit the Warsaw Pact and declare neutrality, 
                                the Soviet Union carried out a full-scale invasion. To maintain its grip on Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union violated Eastern European nations’ right to national self-determination. 
                                The Warsaw Pact and its binding nature exposed the limits and flexibility of what the Soviet Union will tolerate in the absence of Stalin.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump63"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref62">63</a></sup>

                            <h3>Khrushchev's Secret Speech</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;Khrushchev’s Secret Speech to the 20th congress of the Soviet Union’s Communist Party signified what communism in Eastern Europe would look like after the death of Stalin. In his speech, Khrushchev denounced Stalin’s cult of personality and primarily criticized Stalin’s political purging.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump64"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup>
                                The consequences of Khrushchev’s Secret Speech varied throughout Eastern Europe. For instance, Czechoslovakian communists interpreted Khrushchev’s speech as the need to return to the ideas of Marx and Lenin. Since Khrushchev had blamed the failure of communism on Stalin, this had to mean that Stalin’s interpretation of Marx and Lenin had been incorrect. 
                                This was not the case in Hungary and Poland, where revolt and violent resistance immediately followed. 
                                Khrushchev’s Secret Speech disillusioned Eastern European nations that the 
                                objective truth defined by Stalin had been entirely fabricated.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump65"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup>Hungarian and Polish communists saw Khrushchev’s speech as an opportunity to criticize other aspects of communism that he had not mentioned. 
                                In criticizing Stalinism and not establishing a sound alternative, Khrushchev’s Secret Speech heightened tensions within the Soviet Republic 
                                that would eventually lead to the fall of communism.

                            &emsp;The process of de-Stalinization and Nikita Khrushchev’s Secret Speech had prompted discussion in Poland about steering towards a more nationally oriented socialism. The Poznan Protests of 1956 were motivated by the national question and general worker dissatisfaction. 
                            However, the protest quickly escalated into a movement against the communist government of the Polish People’s Republic.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump66"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup>The protests resulted in new leadership under Władysław Gomułka and the Soviet acceptance of national communism in Poland. 
                            The Soviet response in Poland would greatly influence Hungary’s Revolution in 1956. However, Hungary would face a very different response from the Soviet Union. 
                            The Poznan protests highlighted the economic failure of communism within the Soviet-bloc and 
                            foreshadowed the eventual collapse of communism in Poland.

                                &emsp;The Hungarian Revolution demonstrated the limits to which the new form of Soviet communism under 
                                Khrushchev would tolerate – “a certain amount of national communism in Poland and Y/S, 
                                but no overt challenges to Soviet hegemony or to the leading role of the communist parties.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump67"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>The Hungarian Revolution occurred immediately after Khrushchev’s Secret Speech. The revolution spurred from Hungary’s 
                                desire for political independence and a general dissatisfaction with the Soviet Union’s economic policies. 
                                Under the leadership of Imre Nagy, Hungary set on a ‘New Course’, permitting peasants to leave cooperatives, 
                                lessening the security services, and rationalizing Hungary’s unbalanced heavy industry policy.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump68"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup>The Red Army responded by invading Hungary and overtaking Budapest by force. 
                                After the invasion, the Soviets instated Janos Kádár as a Soviet puppet, who would pioneer Goulash communism. 
                                Goulash communism treated communism as a functioning system rather than one based on day-to-day practicality 
                                rather than deviations and ideological disagreements. Additionally, Hungary found no response from 
                                the West when they asked for help during the revolution. Though the Hungarian revolution led to a new form of communism, 
                                it demonstrated that there would not be any change in the Eastern European communist order.

                                &emsp;The Prague Spring of 1968 unveiled the hollowness of communism in Eastern Europe. 
                                It began with Alexander Dubcek’s rise to power and several reforms that liberalized the Czechoslovakia economy, 
                                democratized its political regime, and granted Czechoslovakians the right to freedom of speech and assembly. 
                                These ideas were born by the open interpretation of Nikita Khrushchev’s Secret Speech and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. 
                                Dubcek and Czechoslovakians championed revisionism within communism – the idea that communism had failed under 
                                Stalin’s cult of personality and that for communism to succeed it had to return to its Marxist and Leninist roots.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump69"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup>Dubcek and Czechoslovak’s great misunderstanding behind this was that the Soviet Union still cared about political ideology. In actuality, the political line under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was no longer about ideology but rather personal politics. 
                                Therefore, from the perspective of Brezhnev, Dubcek’s opening of society, releasing of power to the public, 
                                and the appearance of non-conformity by Czechoslovaks was a direct violation of Brezhnev’s trust 
                                and justified invasion by the Warsaw Pact.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump70"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup>The Soviet Union’s violent invasion of Prague in 1968 signified that communism was drained of its emotional and intellectual

                                &emsp;The economic and political repression in Poland during the 1960s culminated in 1968 with the Polish Political Crisis. 
                                The Polish Political Crisis was a series of protests triggered by a large rise in prices accompanied by economic stagnation. 
                                To displace blame for Poland’s economic failure, Władysław Gomułka, 
                                the Polish leader exploited the national question, blaming Poland’s social and economic distress on Jews.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump72"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup>Through an antisemitic campaign, Gomulka purged several thousands of Zionist Jews, who he had blamed for the protests.

                                &emsp;The Brezhnev Doctrine of 1968 indicated that despite Eastern European communism being devoid of its ideological substance, it was still going to remain in Eastern Europe for a long period of time. The Brezhnev Doctrine permitted some national deviation within the Soviet Union’s communist satellites, however, it claimed that “none of [these nations’] 
                                decisions should damage either socialism in their country or the fundamental interests of other socialist countries.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump74"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup>This was a formal justification of the Red Army’s invasion of Budapest during the Hungarian Revolution of 
                                1956 and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Prague during 1968.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump75"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup>Furthermore, the Brezhnev Doctrine showcased the Soviet Union’s commitment to preserving socialism in neighboring countries via force 
                                – severely stifling revolution within soviet-Bloc nations in the ensuing decades. 
                                The Brezhnev Doctrine exposed the Soviet Union’s exhaustion of its social and economic advantages 
                                and highlighted that communism in Eastern Europe would remain only by threat of force.

                                &emsp; Faced with economic downturn and a rising gap between Poland’s prices and the global economy’s prices, 
                                Wladyslaw Gomulka was forced to make an ill-fated political decision – raising prices in Poland. 
                                This ultimately meant taking away the one lingering economic advantage of the Marxist-Leninist system, low prices. 
                                Following yet another working-className protest, Gomulka was replaced by old-time communist Edward Gierek on December 20th.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump76"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup>Gierek’s economic reform was akin to a “communist new deal” motivated by Keynesian economics, a shift to consumerism, and investment in foreign capital. Though his reforms found success in its early stages, 
                                the economic recession of 1973 and the Soviet Union’s rise of oil prices in 1975 led to further economic catastrophe in Poland.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump77"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup>Gierek’s economic policies illustrated the Soviet bloc’s use of substitutions for political ideology,

                                ran out of substitutes. Most importantly, the failure of Gierek’s policies further alienated the party from the 
                                state and paved the path for the formation of Solidarity in 1981.

                                Analogous to Poland this did not actually solve the political issues within Yugoslavia. However,
                                the difference between Yugoslavia and Poland was that because of the Tito-Stalin Split, 
                                Yugoslavia was not limited to the national question defined by the Soviet Union.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump79"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup>This provided room for atrocities carried out by violence within the Yugoslav republic. 
                                In addition, the Yugoslav Constitution was later referenced by Slobodan Milošević to stir Serbian nationalism 
                                and weaponize the national question. The intent behind the Yugoslav Constitution was to provide 
                                a substitution for reform and hold Yugoslavia together, however, it instead drove the eventual 
                                independence and marked the start of the breakup of Yugoslavia.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump80"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup>

                            <p>
                                &emsp;The Helsinki Final Act reflected a dramatic step towards the easing of Cold War tensions. 
                                The document contained an arms control agreement between the Eastern and Western camps and 
                                agreed to support the universality of fundamental human rights in Eastern Europe.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump81"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup>With the Helsinki Act also containing clauses on the inviolability of national frontiers and respect for territorial integrity, 
                                Brezhnev saw the declaration as a means of maintaining stability within the postwar communist order in Eastern Europe. 
                                Yet, the Soviet Union did not uphold the notion of human rights completely. 
                                For instance, a group dedicated to the chronicling of human rights violations was viciously persecuted by the Soviet Union.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump82"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">82</a></sup>Overall, the Helsinki Final Act did have a tremendous impact on the end of communism in Eastern Europe. This is most clear through 
                                the rise of a new nationalism rooted in universal human roots as shown by the Solidarity movement

                                &emsp;Tito’s death marked the end of his leadership of Yugoslavia, which had lasted for over thirty years. 
                                Tito’s ethnic background as a Croat and Slovene allowed him to serve as a counterweight to Serbian nationalism 
                                and kept Yugoslavia united. His death and the Yugoslav Constitution of 1974 meant that there was no longer 
                                an administrative way for solving national differences between the Yugoslav republics. 
                                This gave room to the reemergence of Croatian and Serbian nationalism.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump84"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup>Serbian nationalism under the leadership of Slobodan Milošević,

                                &emsp;In 1981, the communist system did not seem like it was going to disappear in Eastern Europe anytime soon. 
                                However, the Solidarity movement in Poland exposed the limits to the communist theory and its practice 
                                and brought about major social and intellectual changes. Solidarity began as a trade union organized by the Polish working 
                                className and evolved into a trade union representing the first large-scale civil society resistance movement to communism. 
                                Solidarity inherently undermined the Leninist system, as Lenin had believed that the working className would never 
                                be able to gain className consciousness.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump86"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup>Furthermore, through the lessons of the working-className revolts in 1956, 1968, and 1970, Solidarity emphasized the need for political reform alongside economic reform to better society.  As a trade-union, Solidarity made economic demands for cheaper food, cheaper housing, a more efficient agricultural system. However, they also utilized the language of human rights provided by the Helsinki Act of 1975, 
                                demanding freedom of speech, freedom of press, and the punishment of “state and party authorities” 
                                whose arbitrary and irrevocable decisions have caused “immeasurable damage to the social consciousness of the nation.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump87"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup>Despite Solidarity being put down by martial law in 1981, its ideological messages sent a ripple throughout

                            <h3>Mikhail Gorbachev elected president of the Soviet Union</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;Mikhail Gorbachev is often blamed today by Russians for the fall of the Soviet Union. 
                                His drastic and optimistic reforms uprooted the postwar Soviet order. Gorbachev realized that reform between the Soviet center and Soviet periphery were needed. 
                                This meant saving socialism in Eastern Europe via policies of ‘perestroika’ (economic restructuring), 
                                ‘glasnost’ (openness) and ‘demokratsia’ (democracy).<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump88"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup>Gorbachev conceded to the economic downfalls of the Soviet Union and emphasized the need for economic reform. 
                                His economic policies gave opportunity some private economic enterprises, but ultimately led to an increase in food prices, 
                                demands for higher wages, and inflation. Moreover, Gorbachev also acknowledged the need for political reform within Eastern Europe 
                                and domestically. In his speech, “A Common European Home”, 
                                Gorbachev detailed the withdrawal of the Red Army from Soviet satellites, which directly countered the Brezhnev Doctrine of 1968.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump89"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup>Gorbachev believed that if the people of Eastern Europe were given freedom of speech, 
                                they would praise the Soviet Union rather than criticize it. 
                                However, this was not in fact the case. Moreover, Gorbachev held an optimistic perspective on democracy in Eastern Europe. 
                                He believed that even if Eastern Europe had democracy, socialism would eventually triumph. 
                                However, this did not happen and if socialism did return in Eastern Europe, it was no longer socialism by Gorbachev’s conception. 
                                Though Gorbachev “underestimated the power of nationalism, did not understand market mechanisms, and miscalculated his ability to 
                                bring his party and his people along with him on his journey of reform,” the collapse of the Soviet Union was not entirely his fault. 
                                By 1989, the Soviet Union had simply exhausted its political and social resources and run out of ideological substance.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump90"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup>

                                &emsp;The 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia and the death of Tito opened the room for Serbian nationalist Milosevic to rise to power in 1989. 
                                Milosevic quickly began popular with his stirring of Serbian nationalism. For instance, in his speech on 21 February 1974 he 
                                used language conveying Serbian victimhood to rally millions of Serbs. He alluded to the Yugoslavia constitution of 1974, 
                                granting Kosovo and Vojvodina autonomy and “the power to influence federal legislation equal to Serbia itself.”<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump91"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup>Milosevic argued on behalf of the Serbian minority in Kosovo and Vojvodina that they should be united in a greater Serbia. Further, 
                                he demanded that Serbia should no longer have to acquiesce to the limitation on its power set by the Constitution of 1974. 
                                Under Milosevic, Serbian nationalism became extremely militant with his desire for Serbia to take power over the entire Yugoslavia federation.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump92"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref91">92</a></sup>Serbian nationalism would eventually led to collapse of Yugoslavia as shown by  Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia declaring independence in 1991.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump93"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref92">93</a></sup>

                                &emsp;June 1989 was a major turning point for the end of communism in Poland. Poland’s economic problems led to another strike in 1988. 
                                Under Gorbachev’s new policies of reform, the strike resulted in an agreement by the Polish Communist Government to hold semi-free 
                                elections in Poland. After being shut down by martial law in 1981, 
                                Solidarity resurfaced and won a resounding majority of the new Senate seats, winning 92 of the 100 seats in the Senate and 
                                160 of the 161 available in the Sejm. Following the elections, the Communist government struggled for power in the coalition

                                the cutting of the barbed wire also contributed to the fall of communism in East Germany, 
                                allowing the emigration from East Germans to West Germany.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump95"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup>This movement opened the eyes of East Germans under the communist bloc to the significantly higher

                                the cutting of the barbed wire between Austria and Hungary inched Germany towards reunification 
                                and was emblematic of the soon collapse of the Soviet Union.

                                the Ten-Day War between the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) and Slovenian Territorial Defense. 
                                Fortunately, Slovenia was prepared for JNA intervention and Slovenes were able to defeat the JNA.
                                Croatia on the other hand was not prepared for JNA intervention and found difficulty regarding its significant Serb population. 
                                The fight between Croatia and Serbia lasted four years and lead to the destruction of several cities and deaths of thousands of

                                &emsp;The European Union, founded in 1993 was a new definition of a new post-WWII and post-communist order in Eastern Europe – one of union.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump97"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup>During the post-imperial order, the question that emerged in Eastern Europe was what suitable substitutes there were for empire. 
                                The European Union answered this question and provided integration as a substitute for empires and offered a new solution to 
                                solving the national question surrounding borders. The European Union stated that neither minorities in Eastern Europe nor borders 
                                in Eastern Europe would be moved. 
                                Instead, national borders would be open allowing for free movement and free trade. Further with the Copenhagen Criteria of 1993, 
                                only nations that upheld western principles of democracy and competition were allowed to join. 
                                The history of nation-states in Eastern Europe demonstrated that independent entities had little to no possibility of survival.

                            &emsp;The Dayton Accords proceeded the Srebrenica Massacre of 1995 and the ethnic cleansing of 
                            Serbs and Croats during the Bosnian Wars. The Dayton Accords established peace between 
                            Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians and granted each state sovereignty. However, tensions remained between Kosovo and Serbia, 
                            as the Dayton accords had not granted Kosovo independence. This resulted in an insurgency within Kosovo carried out by Albanian Muslims, 
                            who were the majority ethnic group in Kosovo. The insurgency resulted in NATO bombing of Belgrade and the defeat of Serbia and the 
                            discrediting of Milosevic. The Bosnian Wars were the first big conflict since the end of the Cold War. 
                            With the human rights discourse becoming more salient and the reconceptualization of the Holocaust, 
                            the West grew more involved in state making during the post-communist period.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump99"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup>

                            <h3>Russia's Election for Presidency 1999</h3>
                            <p>
                                &emsp;Vladimir Putin’s victory in Russia’s election for presidency in 1999 marked the return of Soviet politics under Stalin. 
                                For instance, while in power Putin resurfaced the “politics of inevitability” – the notion that there are no ideas outside of the party line.
                                Putin blamed nationalism on homosexuals and woman, like Stalin’s execution of the Doctor’s Plot in 1953.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump100"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup>Furthermore, Putin revived the “politics of eternity” introduced by Stalin, making the political present to be 
                                eternal and making his political rule seemingly permanent by alienating the idea of succession. 
                                This is most visibly demonstrated by how he gained popularity in November 1999. 
                                Despite the possibility of self-terrorism in Russia, Putin blamed a series of bomb explosions in Russian cities on the 
                                Chechen republic of southwestern Russia. 
                                This was very similar to how Stalin came to power in 1922, through manipulating the political truth based on the party line. 
                                In both cases, “the ink of political fiction [was] blood.” <sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump101"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup>Furthermore, Putin’s argument of Ukraine belonging to Russia in 2012 and the invasion of Crimea in 2014 
                                echoed the exploitation of the national question under the Stalinist regime.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump102"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup>Many of Putin’s political maneuvers demonstrate the importance of studying history – to prevent atrocities against mankind.

                            <p>
                                &emsp;Ukraine, as the case with many other countries within the Soviet bloc gained independence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. 
                                However, this did not absolve Ukraine from its history of struggle as a nation. 
                                Immediately following its sovereignty, Ukrainian elections throughout the 1990s 
                                were plagued with political corruption and fraud. Following the 2004 election, however, when Viktor Yanukovych 
                                declared victory as Prime Minister in what was evidently a rigged election, a series of peaceful protests known 
                                as The Orange Revolution ensued. The Orange Revolution resulted in bringing Viktor Yuschenko and Yulia Tymoshenko 
                                into office and had an immense effect on Ukrainian nationalism. As seen from the historical trajectory of Ukraine 
                                since it failed to gain sovereignty in 1918, Ukraine was culturally, politically, and economically tied to the Soviet Union. 
                                Thus, after Ukraine finally gained sovereignty nearly a century later, the boundaries between the Soviet Union and Ukraine remained blurry. 
                                However, the mobilization of millions of Ukrainians in the fight for free elections officially solidified an independent 
                                Ukraine and showcased Ukraine was no longer obstructed from the right to self-determination.<sup><a className = "anchor" id="jump103"></a></sup><sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup>
